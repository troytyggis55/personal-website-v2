### About me
I am currently studying for a **bachelor in computer science at NTNU** in Trondheim, Norway.
I have a huge interest in everything technology and I thoroughly enjoy **problem solving**.
This website is one of many programming projects I do in my spare time both for **developing my 
skills** and for **fun**.
